The sketch featured Alex Moffat as host Joe Scarborough and Kate McKinnon as Mika Mika Brzezinski. The sketch also has Alec Baldwin as President Donald Trump, who calls into the show as  John Miller,  a spokesperson for the White House. Back in the day, Trump was known for calling reporters all over the New York area pretending to be his own publicist. He would call, not to tout his business successes but to brag about his sex life.The sketch also made fun of the relationship between the hosts. The pair got engaged recently when they were celebrating Mika s 50th birthday. The sketch shows the response from the other panelists on the show, Mark Halperin, Willie Geist and Mike Barnacle, who all have no idea how to respond to Joe and Mika s behavior on the set.Featured image via Frederick M.

In the aftermath of the disastrous Comey hearing where it was confirmed that The Donald s team was indeed being investigated   and of Rep. Nunes  decision to skip informing his fellow congressional Russia investigators of perfectly legal  incidental collection  of information about Trump associates and possibly the President* himself and run to The Donald with it instead   Trump has been flailing, attempting to distract from the whole Russia thing as much as possible.That s going to be very hard now, as U.S. officials have now confirmed that the facts suggest that members of his team were indeed working with the enemy. CNN reports:The FBI has information that indicates associates of President Donald Trump communicated with suspected Russian operatives to possibly coordinate the release of information damaging to Hillary Clinton s campaign, US officials told CNN.\",\n          \" Vladimir Putin Just Defended Trump In The WORST Way Possible (VIDEO) According to Russian dictator Vladimir Putin, it s silly to worry about little things like whether or not a couple of Russian ladies peed on Donald Trump s bed because it s much, much worse to publish memos that reveal these allegations.Putin says that there is a conspiracy to  delegitimize  the man and his team of hackers, fake news writers, and trolls he worked hard to install in the Oval Office by hacking Trump s political opponents and running an aggressive propaganda campaign. I don t know Mr. Trump, I have never met him, I don t know what he will do in the international arena, so I have no reason either to attack him, criticize him or defend him, Putin said at a press conference. Donald Trump has been with the most beautiful women in the world, so why would he need prostitutes in Moscow? To answer that question, we need only look to a 2001 edition of the Howard Stern Show in which Trump was reminded that he bragged that he likes to go to Russia to have sex with women because they  have no morals. Putin says that Russian security services  do not chase every US billionaire,  and that the release of the documents was worse than prostitutes. In a way, he s right, as the documents presented to both Trump and President Obama also allege that members of the President-elect s campaign staff directly worked with the Russian government during the campaign.On numerous occasions, Trump has repeated Russian propaganda while attacking U.S. intelligence agencies that have been exposing him for what he is and, of course, has directly quoted Putin (a man whom Trump says is  very smart ) while hurling barbs at Hillary Clinton.Trump and Putin have been screaming about the  fake news  release of actual documents that actual intelligence agencies are in possession of, but the BBC reported recently that the whole pissing Russian ladies thing is just the tip of the iceberg. Correspondent Paul Wood revealed last week that at least four sources have confirmed the information, with one U.S. intelligence source informing him that there is audio and video of The Donald s escapades, and an Israeli news source reports that the country s spies have been warned against sharing information with the United States for fear that Trump will relay it to Putin.Putin and Trump s bromance is disconcerting at best   especially when more than a baker s dozen intelligence agencies have confirmed that the man who stood up to join Trump in his attacks on our intelligence agencies has been confirmed to have interfered in our election.Watch it below:Featured image via Getty Images\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n

BRUTALLY Stabs Him In The Back: ‘He’s Pathetic’ (VIDEO) It s looking as though Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is losing support even from within his own ranks. You know things are getting bad when even your top surrogates start turning against you, which is exactly what just happened on Fox News when Newt Gingrich called Trump  pathetic. Gingrich knows that Trump needs to keep his focus on Hillary Clinton if he even remotely wants to have a chance at defeating her. However, Trump has hurt feelings because many Republicans don t support his sexual assault against women have turned against him, including House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI). So, that has made Trump lash out as his own party.Gingrich said on Fox News: Look, first of all, let me just say about Trump, who I admire and I ve tried to help as much as I can. There s a big Trump and a little Trump. The little Trump is frankly pathetic. I mean, he s mad over not getting a phone call? Trump s referring to the fact that Paul Ryan didn t call to congratulate him after the debate. Probably because he didn t win despite what Trump s ego tells him.Gingrich also added: Donald Trump has one opponent. Her name is Hillary Clinton. Her name is not Paul Ryan. It s not anybody else. Trump doesn t seem to realize that the person he should be mad at is himself because he truly is his own worst enemy.

Meadows’ group has opposed House Republican healthcare legislation up to now and threatened earlier in the day to block its passage in a Thursday vote.  '\n"," 'Trump proposes U.S. tax overhaul, stirs concerns on deficit WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump proposed on Wednesday the biggest U.S. tax overhaul in three decades, calling for tax cuts for most Americans, but prompting criticism that the plan favors business and the rich and could add trillions of dollars to the deficit. The proposal drew a swift, skeptical response from Senator Bob Corker, a leading Republican “fiscal hawk,” who vowed not to vote for any federal tax package financed with borrowed money. “What I can tell you is that I’m not about to vote for any bill that increases our deficit, period,” Corker, who said on Tuesday he would not seek re-election in 2018, told reporters. Trump said his tax plan was aimed at helping working people, creating jobs and making the tax code simpler and fairer. But it faces an uphill battle in the U.S. Congress with Trump’s own Republican Party divided over it and Democrats hostile. The plan would lower corporate and small-business income tax rates, reduce the top income tax rate for high-earning American individuals and scrap some popular tax breaks, including one that benefits people in high-tax states dominated by Democrats. Forged during months of talks among Trump’s aides and top congressional Republicans, the plan contained few details on how to pay for the tax cuts without expanding the budget deficit and adding to the nation’s $20 trillion national debt. The plan still must be turned into legislation, which was not expected until after Congress makes progress on the fiscal 2018 budget, perhaps in October. It must then be debated by the Republican-led congressional tax-writing committees. Analysts were skeptical that Congress could approve a tax bill this year, but that is what Republicans hope to achieve so they can enter next year’s congressional election campaigns with at least one legislative achievement to show for 2017. Financial markets rallied on the plan’s unveiling, an event long anticipated by traders betting that stocks would benefit from both faster economic growth and inflation. At an event in Indianapolis, Trump called the plan the largest tax cut in U.S. history. “We want tax reform that is pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-worker, pro-family and, yes, tax reform that is pro-American,” he said. The real estate mogul-turned-politician, who promised big tax cuts as a candidate, told reporters he personally would not gain financially from the proposal. “I think there’s very little benefit for people of wealth,” said Trump, who unlike many of his White House predecessors, has refused to make public his own tax returns. Republicans have produced no major legislative successes since Trump took office in January, even though they control the White House and both chambers of Congress. Their top legislative priority, overhauling the U.S. healthcare system, collapsed again in the Senate on Tuesday. A comprehensive rewrite of the U.S. tax code has eluded previous presidents and Congress for decades. The last one was passed in 1986 under Republican President Ronald Reagan. Trump’s plan falls short of the sweeping, bipartisan package crafted by Reagan and congressional Democrats, analysts said. The White House said that, under the proposal, typical middle-class families would have less income subject to federal tax. Trump said the first $12,000 earned by an individual and the first $24,000 by a married couple would be tax-free. The plan would lower the top individual tax rate, paid by the nation’s top earners, to 35 percent from 39.6 percent. It would lower the top corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from the current 35 percent. The existing rate is high globally, but many U.S.-based multinationals pay much less than the headline rate because of abundant loopholes and tax breaks. Trump has appealed to Democrats to back the plan, although they were not consulted in drafting it. Republicans hold a thin 52-48 Senate majority and may need some Democratic support to win passage. But Democrats said the plan would expand the federal deficit in order to deliver tax cuts to wealthy Americans rather than the middle-class families that Trump and Republicans say they are trying to help.  “If this framework is all about the middle class, then Trump Tower is middle-class housing,” said Senator Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the tax law-writing Senate Finance Committee.      Republican Kevin Brady, chairman of the tax-writing House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee, said he expected tax legislation to be passed by the end of this year. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a Washington-based policy group, estimated on Wednesday the plan contained about $5.8 trillion of total tax cuts over a decade and would have a net cost of $2.2 trillion through 2027. Analysts have warned huge tax cuts would balloon the deficit if economic growth projected by Republicans to offset the costs fails to materialize amid rising interest rates. ‘PASS-THROUGH’ RATE The plan would set a new 25 percent tax rate for “pass-through” businesses, which are usually small, private enterprises, such as partnerships and sole proprietorships. They represent about 95 percent of all U.S. businesses. Under current law, the profits of those companies “pass through” directly to their owners and are taxed as personal income, often at the top 39.6 percent individual income rate. Cutting that to 25 percent could mean big tax savings for small-business owners, but also be vulnerable to abuse by other individuals and companies, analysts said. Republicans proposed eliminating some tax deductions. They did not target the popular ones for mortgage interest and charitable giving, but called for scrapping the one for state and local tax payments. That could especially hurt people in high-tax states like California and New York. In a step to simplify tax returns, the plan would shrink the current seven tax brackets to three: 12 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent. That would raise the bottom tax rate on low-earning Americans to 12 percent from 10 percent, but analysts said other parts of the plan would still mean a net tax cut. '\n"," ...\n"," 'Trump lawyers say judge lacks jurisdiction for defamation lawsuit NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s lawyers told a New York state judge on Tuesday that under the U.S. Constitution she had no jurisdiction over the president and therefore urged her to dismiss a defamation lawsuit by a woman who has accused Trump of sexual harassment. The lawsuit by Summer Zervos, a former contestant on Trump’s reality show “The Apprentice,” contends that Trump’s denials of her accusations amounted to false and defamatory statements. Being “branded a liar” by Trump, the lawsuit said, has harmed her and her business.  Trump’s lawyers, led by Marc Kasowitz, said the Constitution’s Supremacy Clause prevented the judge from letting Zervos’s lawsuit proceed in a state court.  The hour-long hearing was held in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan, where Zervos’s lawyers responded that there was no legal precedent preventing a state court from ruling on the conduct of a president outside his official duties.  “The motion today has nothing to do with putting anyone above the law,” Kasowitz told Justice Jennifer Schecter. Under the Supremacy Clause, he said, “a state court may not exercise jurisdiction over the president of the United States while he or she is in office.” Schecter occasionally stopped Kasowitz to ask him to clarify his views on her jurisdiction. She asked him if it mattered that she would not be directing the president in his official duties, only potentially ruling on whether his comments as a candidate defamed Zervos. Kasowitz said it made no difference.  “What that means is the president being haled into court, and once the president is haled into court there are innumerable obligations that flow from that,” he said, saying this would amount to inappropriate “control” over the president. Mariann Wang, the lead lawyer for Zervos, argued, “There is no case that holds that a federal official cannot be held to account in a state court.”  Trump’s lawyers did not dispute this.  Wang acknowledged that the president holds a unique position but noted that even the president has downtime. They could, for example, meet Trump during one of his weekend visits to his Mar-A-Lago resort in Florida to record a video deposition, she suggested. The judge said she would rule later. Trump’s lawyers have said in court filings that Zervos is making false, self-contradictory and politically motivated accusations and that the president’s remarks were “non-actionable fiery rhetoric.” Zervos has accused Trump of groping her during meetings in 2007. She filed her lawsuit in January, three days before Trump’s inauguration. In March, she subpoenaed Trump’s presidential campaign for any documents concerning similar allegations against him.  Trump has said accusations by Zervos and other women who last year accused him of sexual harassment are false. If the case went ahead, it could lead to Trump being compelled to hand over any documents from his campaign related to any accusations of sexual impropriety made against him.  Zervos’s lawyers, including Gloria Allred, have cited the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in Clinton v. Jones, which allowed former Arkansas state employee Paula Jones’ sexual harassment lawsuit against Bill Clinton to proceed in 1997 while he was still U.S. president.  The decision led to Clinton’s impeachment after he lied under oath about his sexual relationship with another woman, Monica Lewinsky. Trump’s lawyers have said that Clinton v. Jones only applies to lawsuits in federal courts, not state courts. Zervos met Trump after becoming a contestant on NBC’s “The Apprentice” in 2005. She has accused Trump of kissing her against her will at his New York office in 2007 and later groping her in a hotel in Beverley Hills after she met with him about a possible job. She was one of several women who made accusations against Trump after the emergence last year of a conversation caught on an open microphone in 2005 in which he spoke in vulgar terms about trying to have sex with women. Trump has said the comments amounted to “locker room banter,” and his campaign issued a statement in which he apologized if anyone was offended. Since the lawsuit was filed, numerous accusations of sexual misconduct have been made against powerful men in politics, media and entertainment.  '\n"," ' WATCH: Right-Wing Pastor Falsely Credits Trump For Saving The Auto Industry In 2008 Remember that time in 2008 when Donald Trump rode in on a white horse and personally saved the auto industry all by himself? Yeah, me neither. But one of his supporters thinks that actually happened.During an interview on CNN, Trump s favorite pastor, Darrell Scott, stunned former Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer and New Day host Alisyn Camerota by making that exact claim after trashing the Michigan city as a hellhole that only the Republican nominee can fix. Detroit is in bad shape,  Scott said.  It s in bad shape economically, it s in bad shape as far as crime is concerned, and so you have a candidate that s saying,  I want to improve the conditions of the city economically, I want to improve the condition of the city as far as crime is concerned    you can t turn a deaf ear to that, whoever it is. Archer took umbrage to Scott s characterization of the city and warned that voters should scrutinize candidates who make such promises, especially since Trump didn t give a damn about Detroit before his poll numbers imploded.Camerota asked Scott to continue, and when he did he gave Trump credit for something that President Bush and President Obama did in 2008 and 2009 respectively. You have someone saying,  I m going to be put in a position to help Detroit in the areas that it most needs help,  Scott went on.  He bailed out the auto industry. Yes, Scott really did claim that Trump save the auto industry at the height of the Great Recession.Of course, the record is crystal clear that President Bush signed the first bailout of Chrysler and General Motors. When President Obama took office the next year he did even more to help the American auto industry to stay alive and continue competing with foreign automakers.The auto industry is now fully recovered in this country and Donald Trump has absolutely nothing to do with it, something Scott realized moments later as he clumsily attempted to correct himself. I mean, he just, uh, he didn t bail out the auto industry,  Scott embarrassingly admitted.  What I m saying is, he had been working in relationship with the auto industry in order to stimulate the American auto industry.

The Root had its own take: Perhaps Spicer needed some time to compose the  alternative facts  he knew he d have to present after Salmon-Skin Stalin said Tuesday that the new budget has enough money for a down payment on the wall, and Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), the Senate Appropriations Committee s ranking Democratic member, responded on Twitter with,  To be clear, there is NO funding in this bill for ANY kind of down payment on construction of a new border wall. Or, maybe Spicer was nervous about responding to Trump s tweets from earlier Tuesday insisting that the government needed a  good shutdown.' While some blindly loyal Trump supporters are saying that he just owned the press, unfortunately for their narrative and for Spicey here, answering questions he doesn t necessarily like or want to answer is part and parcel of his job. He doesn t get to run away when he doesn t want to talk, or without explaining that his time is getting cut short for something else. Really, Spicer just got owned here.Featured image via screen capture from embedded
